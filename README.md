# PCA_Tensor_Flow
Apply PCA to a known DataSet to learn more about Tensor Flow.
The idea came from reading the article published by Elior Cohen (https://medium.com/towards-data-science/reducing-dimensionality-from-dimensionality-reduction-techniques-f658aec24dfe).
The theory behind PCA is well-known but I just wanted to program it from scratch using the Tensor Flow library.
